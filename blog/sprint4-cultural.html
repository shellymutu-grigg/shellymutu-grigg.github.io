        Neuroplasticity is the ability of brain “grey matter” to develop and re-wire itself as demonstrated in patients recovering from brain and physical trauma.  It proposes that individuals can recover from trauma by re-wiring the brain’s neurons pathways.  Demonstrated in experiments on monkeys where hand tendons were severed and brain activity in the zone was almost normal after reconnection where the scientist were expecting chaos.<br><br>

      <p>
        Having the ability to step outside of one’s comfort zone is a difficult skill to master and engaging with the principals of neuroplasticity uses this skill heavily.  I personally know I need to be challenged or I become bored very quickly which results in an argumentative attitude.  I notice the difference in myself both in a positive and motivated attitude as well as increased levels of patience.  I believe that engaging with the principals of neuroplasticity would develop myself personally as well as assisting others.

        A growth mindset acknowledges that it is difficult situations that develop a mindset that encourages growth.  If the level of an individual’s intelligence/ability is believed to be “fixed” by both the individual and those in the environment around them then there is a high likelihood this result will eventuate.  However, the reverse is also true, therefore believing that all individuals can improve and develop at any stage of their life creates an environment of continuous learning and development (along with some pretty funky ideas).<br><br>

        I thought in more detail about my personal development and acknowledged that I have ignored it for too long.  However, the undertaking earlier this year of regular physical exercise has demonstrated a noticed improvement in my physical and mental wellbeing that I was not expecting.  It also generated a desire to continue feeling “better”.  This was aligned with the contents of the material I reviewed.<br><br>
