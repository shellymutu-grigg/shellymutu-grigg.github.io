      <q>Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. These changes range from individual neurons making new connections, to systematic adjustments like cortical remapping</q> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity#:~:text=Neuroplasticity%2C%20also%20known%20as%20neural,systematic%20adjustments%20like%20cortical%20remapping.">Wikipedia</a>.

      When thinking about this term I envisage a mould of plaster a child or a designer might engage with to create something amazing.  Taking something that has almost no shape and creating something incredible.  By looking at the brain in the same manner that it can be moulded and reformed into what ever the creative imagination can dream provides a sense of confidence that anything is possible.

      Many studies have acredited neuroplasticity with the ability of brain “grey matter” to develop and re-wire itself as demonstrated in patients recovering from brain and physical trauma.  It proposes that individuals can recover from trauma by re-wiring the brain’s neurons pathways.  Demonstrated in experiments on monkeys where hand tendons were severed and brain activity in the zone was almost normal after reconnection where the scientist were expecting chaos.

      So while a nice analogy, one that has a bit of science behind it.

      Having the ability to step outside of one’s comfort zone is a difficult skill to master and engaging with the principals of neuroplasticity uses this skill heavily.  I personally know I need to be challenged or I become bored very quickly which can result in an argumentative attitude.  I notice the difference in myself both in a positive and motivated attitude as well as increased levels of patience when I am challenged.  I believe that engaging with the principals of neuroplasticity would develop myself personally as well as assisting others.

      A growth mindset acknowledges that difficult situations help develop a mindset that encourages growth.  Pushing ones comfort learning zone boundaries helps great growth rather than a stagnant comfort zone.  If an individual believes they do not have the intelligence/ability or ability to complete something then the mindset of that individual is said to be one of “fixed”.  This mindest is solidified if those in the environment around them believe and behave in manners that support this assumption.  However the reverse is also true and has several studies that support that if an individual is challenged and those around them provide and environment of "not yet" then adventurers in life are more likely to seek to challenge themselves as well as enjoying the process of growth.  Therefore believing that all individuals can improve and develop at any stage of their life creates an environment of continuous learning and development (along with some pretty funky ideas).

      I thought in more detail about my personal development and acknowledged that I have ignored it for too long.  However, undertaking more regular physical exercise has shown a noticed improvement in my physical and mental wellbeing that I was not expecting.  It also generated a desire to continue feeling “better”.  This was aligned with the contents of the material I reviewed.
