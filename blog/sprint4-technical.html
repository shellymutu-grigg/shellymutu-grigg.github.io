      I had a situation during the Sprint 04 exercise where the code I was working on during the <code class="positioning-text">JS Gradebook</code> task was not behaving as I expected.  I believed I had the instructions to the system correct but I kept receiving red errors â€“ meaning my work was not correct. 
    </p> 
    <table class="center">
      <tr>
        <th><img class="pic" src="../images/JS-Gradebook-errors.png" alt="Example of code errors in JS Gradebook work"></th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      I tried a variety of different ways to figure out what the problem was.  Because I had written out what the task needed to do in what is termed <code class="positioning-text">pseudocode</code> (meaning that there were comments in my code telling me in plain English what success was meant to look like) I was able to think logically about how the code should therefore behave.
      <br> 
    </p>
    <table class="center">
      <tr>
        <th><img class="pic" src="../images/pseudocode.png" alt="Example of pseudocode"></th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>  
      <br> 
      Once I had the pseudocode concept clear in my head, I tried a few options in the <code class="positioning-text">trail and error</code> technique to see if I was missing anything obvious.  After about half an hour of not being able to work out what the issue was, I took a scheduled break and took Tigre for a walk to try out the <code class="positioning-text">rubber ducky method</code>.  This technique of problem solving is using an inanimate object to explain what you expect your code to do (or what you think it does), in the hopes that by saying it out loud in a clear manner the solution to your problem will show itself.  Tigre and I had several looong conversations during this Sprint.
      <br>

    <table class="center">
      <tr>
        <th><img class="pic" src="../images/Tigre.png" alt="Soft toy 'Tigre' in front of computer monitor"></th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      During the process I first felt curious about why things where not behaving as I expected them to.  After the first couple of attempts at a solution continued to fail, I then moved into the frustrated stage.  The pseudocode and the trial and error techniques of problem solving came naturally to me as a tactile learner (I need to get my hands dirty to understand things) so I really enjoyed them.
      <br>
      Speaking to Tigre on the other hand for the first two or three times felt odd as it was not something I had really done before.  However since he helped me figure out what the problem was (in one case I jus needed to remove two extra <code class="positioning-text">brackets ()</code> from the code), he has become my constant companion ever since.
      <br>
      Once I found a solution, well that called for a <code class="positioning-text">hoopy-dance</code> (to be demonstarted at a later date on special request).
      <br>
      <br>
      Through this process I learnt a couple of things.
      <br>
      1. Reading error messages from the console.log is an art form - one I am still finding my zen with.
      <br>  
      2. My other new best friend besides Tigre is the <code class="positioning-text">console.log()</code> command.  I used this command a lot to help me understand exactly what the code was doing at each step.  This helped me track down the issues in record time!
    </p>

    <table class="center">
      <tr>
        <th><span class="heading-text">A situation where I was able to solve a problem in an elegant way.....</span></th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      One of things I noticed during the Sprint 04 Kata exercises was generally the first attempt at the solution made my code overly complex, clunky and hard to read.  I was really glad I was familiar with the TDD Mantra "red, green, refactor" 
      <br>
      <br>
    </p> 
    <table class="center">
      <tr>
        <th><img class="pic" src="../images/TDD-mantra.png" alt="TDD Mantra red, green, refactor"></th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      <br>
      I was able to review my code and look for improvements or more elegant options for a given solution.  The turning poing came during the stretch exercise during the <code class="positioning-text">JS Olympics</code> task.  Due to the work I had completed in the previous katas I was able to see simple and clean solutions to the problems that were being presented.  Trusty Google helped in this a lot as well. 
    </p>
    <table class="center">
      <tr>
        <th><img class="pic" src="../images/Google.png" alt="Google search page with text query"></th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>   
      During this process I first felt amazing as I could see how the logic fit together and why.  It re-iterated to me that while Java might give a programmer clearer and more frequent error messages, <code class="positioning-text">JavaScript</code> ensures that a programmer really has to understand what they are doing and why, otherwise the code is just a black hole and trying to find where your error lies is quite complicated.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through this process I learnt a couple of things.
      <br>
      1. Google has seen it all before
      <br>  
      2. There are many different ways to solve an issue, some of them are not so elegant and others are just plain <code class="positioning-text">AwEsOMe</code>

      There are many problem solving techniques and I have reflected on each below as follows:

    <div class="table-center">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Pseudocode</code> - As a tactile learner this helps me a lot and I find I use it regularly.  It helps keep me focused on the task a hand and helps prevent distraction</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Trying something</code> - Trail and error is also something I gel very naturally with.   While it can be frustrating at times, it is a good way for me to use other techniques as well (such as console.logging) to work out where the errors are</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Rubber ducky method</code> - I implement the Tigre solution!</th>

        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Reading error messages</code> - Is a real Art form as you can identify the line of the code and the file that is causing an issue.  Usually you are able to work out what is causing an error from the message that is being displayed</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Console.logging</code> - Is one of my new best friends!</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Googling</code> - This is a technique that is not only helpful to developers but across many roles.  As things are now being digitised more and more, each day introduces new material for people to be able to access.  The only catch with this technique is knowing where and how to look for the information as it can become like finding a needle in a haystack</th>

          <th><code class="table-text">Asking your peers for help</code> - I have used this to date in Foundations and found talking with other peers very helpful</th>

        <tr>
          <th><code class="table-text">Improving process with reflection</code> - Being able to look back helps solidify lessons being learnt.  I have also found I revisit items in freeCodeCamp or previous Foundation Sprints where I was not 100% sure on the solution and try the problem again to bed down the knowledge of what was being taught</th>
