            <p>
                <span style="color:#6e587e;font-weight:bold"> I strive to honour the following top 5 personal values:</span><br><br>
                   1. <b>Tika</b> - Knowing what is right and being honest.  Having strong moral principles and <br> living by them even if there is a cost. This starts with being able to look <br>at myself in the  mirror and be proud of my decisions and actions<br>
                    2. <b>Manaakitanga</b> – looking to and prioritising the well-being of others<br>
                    3. <b>Whanaungatanga</b> - establishing and maintaining relationships, especially with those I <br>whakapapa to – and knowing when to walk away from them<br>
                   4. <b>Kaitiakitanga</b> – caring for Papatūānuku and taking care to preserve her ability to give us life.<br>
                    5. <b>Mana</b> – maintaining my own power and authority to make my own decisions about my own life.<br>
            </p>

                One instance where I had to make an ethical decision where I had to weigh up my values was in my previous professional role. I was placed in a situation where I could see that both management and senior team members were making what I felt were poor decisions due to lack of time, cost and resources, rather than making difficult decisions to ensure the project delivered the best quality and stability within the limitations provided.  The role I was assigned had a key responsibility of verify both quality and stability of the final product. It reached a point where I was asked to compromise my personal value of Tika (integrity) to allow the project to move ahead and release a low-level quality product into production.  I am proud of my professional reputation and the history of high-quality products that I have had the honour of being a part of delivering.  Over many months I used a variety of different methods and techniques to demonstrate and generate discussions about the shortcomings of the product because of the shortcuts being taken. I researched additional methods to try and find a better way to demonstrate the need for the integrity of the product.  It became evident that I was not being heard and my personal value of Tika was being asked to be compromised.  I had to take a step back and decide which was more important to me: my wages or my personal value of Tika.  I had a difficult choice to make.  Following long discussions with both myself and my family I resigned. This challenged me both personally and professionally as I am by nature a finisher and leaving a task incomplete goes against my grain.  It also meant in the difficult time of COVID-19 my family and I were without income as I was the sole income earner of our household.  However, compromising my personal value of Tika was not a path I was prepared to walk, whatever the final cost.  I remain at peace with myself for making and standing by my decision.

                I am a New Zealand Māori wāhine hailing from the Te Rarawa, Ngāti Kahu and Ngāti Whātua iwi. My upbringing has led me to identify strongly with both my Māori heritage and culture.  One of the key aspects of the Māori culture is whānau (but in the wider context of community) and making sure actions are completed for the greater good not just for the individual.  Each whānau member is respected and is given the chance to be heard.  I try to embody this in both my personal and professional life.  Whānau is not limited to blood relations but also encompasses those around you who you interact with on a regular basis.  Given the challenges both Māori culture and people face on a daily basis I strive to be incredibly conscious of other people’s cultures and strive to be as respectful of other cultures as I wish people to be of mine.  
                I believe the New Zealand Māori culture is one of inclusion rather than exclusion.  Individual voices are valued and given their time to be heard as long as they respect others right to the same.  I see it as an extended democratic model whereby the majority view will move forward, however long it may take to decide on the majority view. I have followed this approach as much as possible in both my professional and personal life that embodies my identity. As a result, my New Zealand Māori culture has had a significant influence on me as a person and my associated personal values.

            <h1 id="technical-blog-header">Strengths and Limitations:</h1>
            <h3>03<sup>rd</sup> September 2020</h3>
            <p>
                From discussions with my family and friends I believe my two greatest strengths are:<br>
                1. <b>Determination / Perseverance</b> - (or pig-headedness as my husband describes it)  I will continue to try and <br>complete a task or a challenge to the highest standard possible at whatever cost.  <br>
                2. <b>Honesty</b> - I am well known with my whānau that I will stick to honesty at whatever the cost.  
            </p>
            <p>
                My two greatest strengths are also my two greatest limitations.  <br>
                <b>1.</b>  My determination to complete a task or challenge can at times prevent me from living in the moment and enjoying what is right in front of me.  I can wind up with tunnel vision and not see other opportunities that surface along the way because I am so fixated on completing a task at whatever cost.  On many occasions it has been clear accepting defeat rather than continue was a more sensible and less painful way forward.<br>
                <b>2.</b> Honesty can come in many forms and being honest about every detail is not always necessary as it can lead to unintended offense or additional workload that one cannot really afford.  It is not always necessary to be as honest as I always am as it may have unintended consequences for both myself and those around me.  <br>Finding the right zen of honesty is a delicate balance, one I am still striving to obtain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My determination and honesty I believe have and will continue to assist me in my learning and career development.  They allow me to have the confidence in myself that I have the tools to complete a task to the best of my ability.  I am also confident that as my approach will be honest the results will be genuinely won whatever the outcome.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I believe my strength of perseverance will go a long way to help my learning journey.  Being able to continue or find workarounds to allow one to proceed will help overcome learning obstacles.
            </p>

                In a previous project I was on there was an individual who I came into conflict with due to my role and my gender.  As senior female a lack of respect as well as a tendency to undermine decisions developed.  As a team each of us held a responsibility for delivering our portion of work to the best of our abilities.  We had also all pledged as a team to support each other to deliver a successful outcome.  I used three of strategies to deal with this issue:<br><br>
                1. Identify & Understand<br>
                2. Discuss<br>
                3. Independent assessment<br><br>
                I had both noticed and other team members had commented on the individual’s behaviour.  I took a step back and thought about why the behaviour was manifesting.  I tried to understand the rationale for what was being seen.  I identified due to the individuals culture my gender and position conflicted with each other.  I tried to think of methods to counteract this and remove the tension from the team.  
                I then discussed the issue and my observations with other team members to identify other viewpoints and other suggestions to resolve the issue.  I then sat down with the individual and another team member to discuss the behaviour to try to resolve the issue.  This did not prove to be successful.
                Lastly, I requested that another senior member of the team take over the management of the individual.  The member was also female and experienced the same issues I was encountering.  Sadly, as the organisation as a group was not able to identify a way to help adjust the individual’s behaviour their contact was not renewed.    
                If I came across this experience in the future I think I would ask for the independent assessment as a second step rather than the last as I think it would be more beneficial to assess at a wider observation first and then discuss with the individual to find a way forward to hopefully successfully resolve a similar situation as I think  this approach could have a different outcome.
