      1. I tend to be incredibly hard on myself if I do not complete something to the level, I believe I should.  This is something I was already aware of, but something I have started to pay more attention to over the Foundations course.
      <br>
      2. I am prepared to put my health at risk to complete something to the best of my abilities which is not necessary.
      <br>
      3. Like many others I enjoy having my ego stroked when I have accomplished things above what is expected.  However, this does set me up for failure with myself as I do not necessarily need to continually be an over achiever.  It is good for my ego to remember there are areas I need to improve on.

      Values in learning & programming: helps an individual understand why both they and others act or implement things the way that they do.  It will assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses to utilise and improve as needed for both the individual and within a team structure. 
      <br>
      Empathy in learning & programming: To kill a mockingbird - "climb into his skin and walk around in it".  Try to understand how someone else is feeling and how that may influence their behaviour.  This is key in a team environment to get the most out of the experience be it learning or programming. 
      <br>
      Self-awareness learning & programming: Understanding why an individual will react or behave to something.  Being aware of this or not will either help someone integrate or separate them from a team.  Being conscious of oneself will provide an avenue for self-improvement.

      Probably the amount that I enjoyed it.  It is an area I have been looking into for a while, but possibly not is as much detail to provide as much benefit as the Foundations course has.  At times, the core activities did feel a bit tedious, however I could see the value in them.  Introspections helps a person identify areas to improve and be conscious of if they are patient and kind with themselves.  An old project manager of mine once said that if you have not learned something new each day then you should change jobs.  I can more fully understand what he meant by that now.  Not only from a technical but also emotional intelligence standpoint.

      Staying focused to achieve the most out of the core activity and prevent myself getting distracted by the possibility of more "interesting technical" challenges in technical tasks.

      I have had first-hand experience of team members who do not behave as part of a team and have little self-awareness and or empathy.  It makes the teams work to achieve their goals exponentially more difficult to co-ordinate and complete regardless of how intellectually intelligent team members are.  This adds time and resource overhead costs to generally already tight budgets.  The final product can also be compromised due to difficult work relationships not providing the optimal results.  I believe it is to combat this problem.

      Not at all, it is an incredibly valuable activity.  It has helped me get back into habits that I had abandoned for no good reason such as meditation and I have seen the benefits of reigniting these habits already.

      No, programming is a skill I will consciously refine over the period that programming becomes my career.  Core skills are something that are very rarely taught or valued.  They are a core element of the MƒÅori culture and I believe they have an incredibly valuable position in society.
