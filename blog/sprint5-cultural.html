      1. I tend to be incredibly hard on myself if I do not complete something to the level, I believe I should.  This is something I was already aware of, but something I have started to pay more attention to over the Foundations course.
      <br>
      2. I am prepared to put my health at risk to complete something to the best of my abilities which is not necessary.
      <br>
      3. Like many others I enjoy having my ego stroked when I have accomplished things above what is expected.  However, this does set me up for failure with myself as I do not necessarily need to continually be an over achiever.  It is good for my ego to remember there are areas I need to improve on.

    <p> 
      Values in learning & programming: helps an individual understand why both they and others act or implement things the way that they do.  It will assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses to utilise and improve as needed for both the individual and within a team structure. 
      <br>
      Empathy in learning & programming: To kill a mockingbird - "climb into his skin and walk around in it".  Try to understand how someone else is feeling and how that may influence their behaviour.  This is key in a team environment to get the most out of the experience be it learning or programming. 
      <br>
      Self-awareness learning & programming: Understanding why an individual will react or behave to something.  Being aware of this or not will either help someone integrate or separate them from a team.  Being conscious of oneself will provide an avenue for self-improvement.

      Probably the amount that I enjoyed it.  It is an area I have been looking into for a while, but possibly not is as much detail to provide as much benefit as the Foundations course has.  At times, the core activities did feel a bit tedious, however I could see the value in them.  Introspections helps a person identify areas to improve and be conscious of if they are patient and kind with themselves.  An old project manager of mine once said that if you have not learned something new each day then you should change jobs.  I can more fully understand what he meant by that now.  Not only from a technical but also emotional intelligence standpoint.

    <p> 
      I have had first-hand experience of team members who do not behave as part of a team and have little self-awareness and or empathy.  It makes the teams work to achieve their goals exponentially more difficult to co-ordinate and complete regardless of how intellectually intelligent team members are.  This adds time and resource overhead costs to generally already tight budgets.  The final product can also be compromised due to difficult work relationships not providing the optimal results.  I believe it is to combat this problem.

      Not at all, it is an incredibly valuable activity.  It has helped me get back into habits that I had abandoned for no good reason such as meditation and I have seen the benefits of reigniting these habits already.

      No, programming is a skill I will consciously refine over the period that programming becomes my career.  Core skills are something that are very rarely taught or valued.  They are a core element of the MƒÅori culture and I believe they have an incredibly valuable position in society.

      Reflecting on my goals from Sprint 02, I have a short-term goal of being a Senior Developer/Lead Developer.  I would like to work in Agile environments where a culture of learning and support is actively adopted and encouraged from the CEO down.  Once I have the experience that I feel is necessary I have a long-term goal of starting-up my own business in Web development.  I would like the experience of working in development environments both in NZ and internationally.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about both my strengths and weaknesses, I believe that they have remained the same as they are a fundamental part of me that I look to optimise and celebrate:

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      <br>
      I have noticed during Foundations that I am far more conscious in the moment of these traits rather just in a hindsight perspective that was often glossed over in the past.
      <br>
      As always, my Tika will help me ensure that any work that is completed is executed to the best of my ability.  I do have to be careful of this to provide a bit more leniency to both myself and others. 
      <br>
      My Hiringa has helped me complete the Foundations tasks ahead of schedule (also because I am totally engaged and enjoying the material) and I believe this will continue to see these results in bootcamp.  I have however noticed during Foundations that I regularly worked longer hours than I should have compromising my exercise time and my circadian rhythm.  This is not beneficial to me either physically or mentally.  As such I will make a conscious effort to disconnect and provide myself sufficient time to unwind at the end of the day in both mental and physical manners. 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be learning to accept my limitations and be understanding of myself if a task remains incomplete.  I am not a machine and cannot keep going at whatever cost.  I need emotional, physical, and intellectual balance in my life as does everyone else.  Committing to only technical improvement at whatever cost will not allow me to achieve the outcomes that I want from the Dev Academy course.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to develop the following non-technical skills (human skills) while at EDA:
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <table class="center">
      <tr></tr>
      <tr>
        <th class="table-text">1.	Improving my reflective and mentoring skills.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th class="table-text">2.	Work on not taking a lead role in all situations.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th class="table-text">3.	Encourage others to develop their leadership abilities.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr></tr>
    </table>  
    <p>
      <br>
      My expectation of myself on Bootcamp is that if I have been worrying at a task for more than half an hour without finding a satisfactory result, I will ask cohort members.  If I still have not found an answer after an hour, then I will reach out to the EDA staff for help.   If I am still unable to resolve the issue, this task will be noted to go into the ‚Äúfor future development‚Äù bucket to allow me to progress with other tasks.
      <br>

    <table class="center">

      <tr>
        <th>
          <span class="heading-text">My commitment:</span>
        </th>
      </tr>
    </table> 
    <p>
      I commit to being 100% present both mentally and physically during the entire bootcamp (if life events permit).  I will review the work that is needed to be completed and assess the time it will take.  I will timebox my efforts and work on learning to accept if I am not able to complete a task with the understanding that my grade for myself is not yet.  If it is incomplete, then it is an area to improve on in the future.
      <br>
      I commit to being conscious of other learners and understand that everyone maybe at different levels or stages of their learning development and as such be respectful of that.
      <br>
      I commit to the tuakuna/teina learning style that I will be able to learn as much from someone else as we are both prepared to commit.  I am responsible for my achievements and it is an honour to be a part of someone else‚Äôs journey.
