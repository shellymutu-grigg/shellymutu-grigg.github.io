          <h2>Thoughts:</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            I have always been interested in development and I would like to develop my skills into being a Senior Developer working in an Agile environment.  I have an interest in penetration testing as such would like to look at this area in relation to development.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Along the journey of discovering development skills I would also like to develop the following soft skills to help me in life:
            <br>
            1. Develop my mentoring skills to be able to help people more.
            <br>
            2. Work on my impartiality as I am aware that my responses to questions can be influenced by emotions at times.
            <br>
            3. Motivating others in a positive manner (it is something I greatly appreciate from others).
            <br>
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            To help me in my journey I have two key strengths which are:
            <br>
            1.<b><em> Tika</em></b> (my integrity) 
            <br>
            2.<b><em> Hiringa</em></b> (perseverance).  
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe in being honest and standing by Tika for both myself and for those around me.  It has gained me a well-earned reputation in my professional career that I am proud of.  My hiringa pushes me through challenges to the best of my ability and encourages those around me to do the same.  
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Thankfully or unfortunately depending on how you look at it my greatest strengths also translate into my greatest weaknesses.  As I can be honest to a fault, I may cause unintended offense or create additional work for myself because of my honesty.  The same applies for my value of perseverance.  Where others will give up in frustration I will keep going and often end up picking up others work to see something through to the end.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> 
            I am aware that I must be conscious of the amount of work I take on to prevent burning myself out and overloading my stress levels.  I commit to understanding what is required of me, being clear in the amount of time I will be able to dedicate to it and draw the line to ensure I give sufficient time to my family, my sports and ensuring my overall wellbeing.  I also commit to assisting the other adventurers on this journey in a productive and positive manner.
          </p>
          <p class="lead"> 
            To reduce frustration with this adventure as much as possible, I commit to ensuring that if I have spent more than 1/2 an hour on the same problem I will reach out to my fellow adventurers and or the facilitators rather than continue without results.
          </p>    
          <p class="lead"> 
            I am looking at this course as an opportunity for myself to develop my abilities to learn and challenge my own ways of working to get the best out of myself.  I expect the facilitators to be like the role of a graduate supervisor at university at stage 4.  They are there for guidance and to check-in with to hold me accountable and provide feedback, but are not there to provide the answers.
          </p> 
          <p class="lead"> 
            I will be blocking out times for my exercise four times a week as well as daily time with my husband as these are important parts of my daily wellbeing. 
          </p>
