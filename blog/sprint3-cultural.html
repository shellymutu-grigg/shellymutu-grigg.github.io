        EQ or emotional quotient describes the ability of an individual to be aware of and manage their emotional state, that of others and be cognisant of how emotions will impact a situation or any resulting decision.  Those with high EQ rankings can read non-verbal cues from people they are interacting with and are able to empathise well with those around them as well as build strong relationships.  People with high EQ generally make good leaders and can actively adopt the five attributes:

        Emotional intelligence reflects a person's capacity for being able to reason using emotional information.

        Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ - also referred to as intellectual intelligence) "is a total score derived from a set of standardized tests or subtests designed to assess human intelligence" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">Wikipedia 2020 </a>.  Up until recently compared to EQ, IQ was only the method of determining a individual’s likelihood of professional success. High levels of IQ are celebrated by way of awards and organisations such as Mensa who require individuals to demonstrate they have attained a score within the upper two percent of the population on an approved IQ test that has been properly administered and supervised.  IQ is relatively straight forward to define and measure.  There are large numbers of accredited tests that are available and are recognised internationally to measure an individual’s IQ.<br><br>
              
        In contrast EQ is still in its infancy when it comes to peer reviewed and critically assessed academic studies to understand its nature and being able to clearly measure it.  While there are several online line tests that can be used to understand one’s EQ such as <a href="https://testyourself.psychtests.com/testid/3979">Test Yourself Psychtests</a>, they are not necessarily accredited nor recognised internationally as a standard for measuring ones EQ.  There are many schools of thought on EQ however the most referenced are those attributed to academics Peter Salovey and John Mayer.  The current measure the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test <em>(MSCEIT)</em> is based on a series of emotion-based problem-solving items to assess ones EQ.  Many individuals are either unaware or are uncomfortable with the concept of EQ while there are others who sit comfortably at the other side of the spectrum who are comfortable and are aware of theirs and the emotions of others.

          Human beings are made up of various components depending on which religion or culture one may or may not subscribe to.  I believe an individual is made up of the body, mind, and spirit.  Without nurturing all three a person is not able to reach their full potential. The body of an individual can be influenced heavily either consciously or unconsciously by one’s mind and spirit.  An individual’s mind is made up of both emotive and logical (or illogical depending on the mood) thought patterns.  By being aware and identifying both of these thought patterns allows an individual to find more fulfilment and satisfaction in their lives and therefore the impact they have on the lives of others around them.  I would also propose that by increasing one’s EQ one would also be able to boost their IQ as well.  The spiritual aspect of an individual and their community is a deep and encompassing topic that should be treated with respect and reverence even if one does not believe in the concept.
